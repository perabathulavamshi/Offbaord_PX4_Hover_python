# Offbaord_Python_Hover-Dehover
python script of offboard_px4 mavros example with hover and dehover functions.

## 📖 Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of an offboard control script for drones using PX4 and MAVROS. The script allows the drone to hover and dehover autonomously, showcasing precise control and stability in real-world conditions. This project is an excellent example of integrating robotics, Python, and flight control systems for autonomous drone operations.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement offboard control using PX4 flight stack and MAVROS.
- Enable drones to autonomously hover at a specified height and dehover when required.
- Test and validate stability and performance of the control system.

## 🛠️ Key Features

### 🔍 Hover and Dehover Control
- Autonomous control to maintain a stable hover at a defined altitude.
- Smooth transition between hover and dehover states for seamless operations.

### 📈 Offboard Mode Implementation
- Utilizes MAVROS to enable communication between PX4 and the control script.
- Sends position and velocity commands to achieve precise flight control.

### 🎨 Real-World Testing
- Tested in simulated and real environments for robustness.
- Ensures stability and responsiveness under various conditions.
